Here is my beautiful and elegant bounded queue!

I've taken the instructions about runtime and memory optimisation rather literally and written it in C++. The program comes with two modes, an interactive mode where you type commands to add and remove to the queue along with other exciting commands. The second mode is testing which - surprise surprise - runs a bunch of tests. 

To compile everything just type 'make' at the command line. 
To run the interactive mode type './main', further instructions are given as it runs. 
To run the exciting tests type './main -test'
